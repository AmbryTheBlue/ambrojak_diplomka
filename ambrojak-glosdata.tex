It is widely used across Europe and other signatory countries to ensure uniformity and legal clarity in international road logistics}

\glos{MD}{Misclassification Detection – An anomaly detection approach that flags an observation as anomalous if the predicted class label differs from the observed one. Trained only on verified, non-anomalous data, it assumes label consistency across similar inputs.}

\glos{FBOD}{Frequency-Based Outlier Detection – A method based on measuring how often a given categorical feature combination has appeared in historical data. Rare combinations are considered likely anomalies. Often enhanced using back-off smoothing to address data sparsity.}

\glos{CBAD}{Confidence-Based Anomaly Detection – An anomaly is predicted if the classifier assigns a low probability to the label present in the data. Typically uses softmax outputs and compares them against a threshold.}

\glos{MSP}{Maximum Softmax Probability – A baseline method for detecting out-of-distribution samples using the highest softmax confidence score. Low confidence suggests that the input is atypical or erroneous.}
