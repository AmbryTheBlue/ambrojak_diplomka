abstract = {Experimental comparison and analysis of unsupervised outlier detection techniques.Based on ROC, precision-recall, computation time, memory usage and robustness.Extend a nonparametric Bayesian method to model numerical and categorical features.Experiments make use of novel industrial datasets and assess generalization abilities. We survey unsupervised machine learning algorithms in the context of outlier detection. This task challenges state-of-the-art methods from a variety of research fields to applications including fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnoses and data cleaning. The selected methods are benchmarked on publicly available datasets and novel industrial datasets. Each method is then submitted to extensive scalability, memory consumption and robustness tests in order to build a full overview of the algorithms characteristics.},

The model offers, via a nonlinear recursive procedure, a computation and space efficient solution to the problem of estimating probabilities from sparse data. This solution compares favorably to other proposed methods. While the method has been developed for and successfully implemented in the IBM Real Time Speech Recognizers, its generality makes it applicable in other areas where the problem of estimating probabilities from sparse data arises.},

ABSTRACT = {Detecting anomalies in time series data is important in a variety of fields, including system monitoring, healthcare and cybersecurity. While the abundance of available methods makes it difficult to choose the most appropriate method for a given application, each method has its strengths in detecting certain types of anomalies. In this study, we compare six unsupervised anomaly detection methods of varying complexity to determine whether more complex methods generally perform better and if certain methods are better suited to certain types of anomalies. We evaluated the methods using the UCR anomaly archive, a recent benchmark dataset for anomaly detection. We analyzed the results on a dataset and anomaly-type level after adjusting the necessary hyperparameters for each method. Additionally, we assessed the ability of each method to incorporate prior knowledge about anomalies and examined the differences between point-wise and sequence-wise features. Our experiments show that classical machine learning methods generally outperform deep learning methods across a range of anomaly types.},
